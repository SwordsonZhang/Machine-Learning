# Machine-Learning
Basic Theory of Machine Learning
This is the summary of Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng. on Coursera.com. And I recommend readers to learn his video courese online which I think it is very useful. Thanks to Prof. Andrew Ng. very much.
Then there maybe something wrong in this file, so you can make a comment and correct them or send me an email swordsonzhang@gmail.com. 

# 1st Change: version1.1

Add new contents about SGD with momentum in Annotations of Chapter 2 "Regression Problem"

So if you want to download the file, you just need download the newest file with suffix "version1.1".

# 2nd Change: version1.2

This version add a new chapter "Data Preprocessing". 

I think it is really import to preprocess initial data set before you start train your model with them.

But there are still some contents such as random forest (decision tree) and LDA which need more time to understand, 
so next time I will update another version.

Then I am planning write something about convolutional neural networks.

# 3rd Change
Upload files of original lectures.

Upload code source files written by myself to plot most of pictures in this booklet.
